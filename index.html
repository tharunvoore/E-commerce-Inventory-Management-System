        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            During the creation of the e-commerce Inventory Warehouse Management System I performed design work as the lead team member.
            of the development team. I enforced the application core by developing its fundamental sections as one of my project responsibilities.
            I established the logic framework that united presentation elements with operational components. 
            The development process required me to establish complicated APIs for uniting the database with external information sources.
            data to our application logic. Such integration facilitated inventory monitoring for our team based operations.
            The company should implement e-commerce platforms which enable the creation of automated stock replenishment workflows.
            System notifications depended on the team members coordinating their work efforts with each other.
            Various sprints tracked system components leading to measurable outputs in which all system features were essential parts.
