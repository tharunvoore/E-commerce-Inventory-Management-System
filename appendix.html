        <h2>Specific Focus Areas</h2>
        <p>The Inventory Management Project focused on the following key areas to drive operational efficiency and scalability:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Inventory Forecasting and Demand Planning</strong> – Predictive analytic techniques were used to forecast demand based on historical sales data and observed seasonal trends. This helped businesses maintain optimal stock levels, preventing overstock and stockouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Inventory Tracking</strong> – A system was implemented to track inventory updates in real time, including keeping a record of quantities of current stock, product locations, and their movements.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Stock Replenishment</strong> – Rules were set up to allow automatic reordering of products when stock levels dropped below defined thresholds. Algorithms actively monitored inventory levels and integrated with supplier and procurement systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Order Fulfillment Optimization</strong> – Order processing was optimized by improving picking, packing, and shipment processes. This enhanced overall efficiency and reduced order fulfillment times.</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable Reporting and Dashboard</strong> – Visualization tools were utilized to showcase various metrics such as sales trends, inventory turnover rates, stock levels, product changes, and other key performance indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration with E-commerce Platforms</strong> – The system integrated with e-commerce platforms to automate inventory synchronization, ensuring product information remained accurate and up-to-date.</li>
        </ol>
